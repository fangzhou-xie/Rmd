```{r child="children/chunk_options.Rmd"}
```

This is a spike to install all packages recognized as "Hadleyverse"

Metacran has very useful API: https://github.com/metacran/crandb#the-raw-api

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

db <- fromJSON("http://crandb.r-pkg.org/-/latest")
hadley_pkgidx <- lapply(db, function(x) grepl("hadley", x$Author, ignore.case = TRUE))
hadley_pkgnames <- names(db)[unlist(hadley_pkgidx)]

hadley_pkgnames
```

Then, install.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(hadley_pkgnames)
```

But I think this is too many. Obviously, we need curated-`installHadley()`...
